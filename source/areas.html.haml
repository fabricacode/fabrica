        We produce artefacts that bring a unique view or statement to a particular context, produced through design processes that are questioned each time. We work with printed three dimensional & digital languages, visual and spoken sketches, hybrid products and approaches, and through constant editing. We design on different scales from artisanal to industrial, from conceptual projects to international exhibitions and object collections, from installations to media and apps, researching about how contemporary communication is changing the way we live, work and engage with cultures.<br/><br/>
