			Our Being and Dying studio investigates current approaches to dying, using experimental design to instigate change at the personal, social and cultural level. We design, build and promote better ways to die. Rather than seeing death in stark opposition to life, however, the studio also researches broader issues around health and the environment, preventative and holistic healthcare. Through projects, prototypes, workshops and seminars, the studio aims to improve everyone's quality of life and death.<br/>
			<br/>
			We produce self-directed research projects, in collaboration with partners, that range from experimental aesthetic reflections - design fictions, media, exhibitions, installations - through to service design- and experience design-led engagements with clients, such as health services, clinics, schools and so on. We also produce our own media (books, essays, films, apps) as well as run focused lecture series and symposia. We use Fabrica as a test-bed and experimental environment, as well as creating site-specific installations and exhibitions.

			Exploring the emerging DNA of 21st century social movements, enterprises and cultures, especially working with United Colors of Benetton. Addressing social and cultural issues; wars, censorship, diversity, politics, we explore how to use arresting imagery to capture attention, and then lead people towards tools, which build genuine capacity and resilience.<br/><br/>

			The Document Studio focuses on documentary and documentation as an integral part of the creative process. We employ the languages and techniques of audio-visual documentation and digital storytelling to reflect on current social and cultural issues. We investigate the blurry line between fiction and non-fiction. We document with the aim to understand, but we use documentary to pose questions rather than give simplistic answers.<br/><br/>

			Our Making and Designing studio uses design to research, articulate and convey and evoke stories about people and places. The cultures and practices of making are also explored through this studio, yet the focus is on producing artifacts and events in order to understand and connect.<br/><br/>

			<b>Networked Politics</b>
		%p
			<b>Marco Ferrari and Joseph Grima</b>

	.studioinfo
		.studioleft
			Our Networked Politics studio explores how our various cultures of decision-making, from formal politics to informal protest, are radically changed in the age of the network. We are looking at the changing nature of protest - Occupy, Arab Spring, Istanbul, Wikileaks and beyond -  including the relationship between physical spaces, cities and contemporary digital tools. We're interested in the shifting modes and possibilities of contemporary decision-making (currencies such as Bitcoin; cultures such as open source and radical transparencies; governance models like liquid democracy, crowd-funding and crowdsourcing; forms of organisation such as communes and autonomous states).<br/>
			<br/>
			NetPol creates exhibitions, media, apps and artifacts in order to articulate research about how our various cultures of decision-making, from formal politics to informal protest, are being transformed as a result of The Network. We work on design and communications projects with clients from governments to galleries, in order to effect real change, as well as producing our own media, documentaries, platforms and objects, software, scenarios and events.<br/><br/>

			<b>New Journalism</b>
		%p
			<b>Enrico Bossan</b>

	.studioinfo
		.studioleft
			Journalism continues to radically transform, its dynamics — at the mainstream and the edges — reinvented every year throughout the first decades of the 21st century. Yet some patterns also persist. This studio explores the practice, culture and meaning of journalism in our time, through projects. Our particular take on journalism is in being, as the original strapline of Colors had it, “about the rest of the world”, and we understand that “otherness” through culture, geography, time and perspective.<br/><br/>

			<b>Sound Interaction</b>
		%p
			<b>Francesco Novara</b>

	.studioinfo
		.studioleft
			We explore the relationship between sound and objects, spaces, people and interactions. We use sound as a starting point, but the outcome might be objects, media, events and artefacts. Sound is one of the least understood yet most powerful senses (you can easily close your eyes but not easily close your ears) and we develop projects that articulate the relationship between sound and communication.<br/><br/>

		%p
			<b>Aaron Siegel</b>

	.studioinfo
		.studioleft
			Investigating the dense spaces where people collect and live out their lives. A focus on how people interact with each other and their environment, the norms and standards of living in an urban setting, navigation and communication in urban environments, and the types of artifacts people leave behind both physically and virtually.<br/>
			<br/>
			Subjects of research include sensing environmental characteristics, visualizing data collected and produced by people and things in urban areas, transportation and communication networks, graffiti and street art culture, activating public space for social engagement and play, and homelessness and nomadic living.<br/><br/>
